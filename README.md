# JavascriptTextEditor

This is a editor built in javascript. Its purpose is for computer science students to be able to type code easily while also being able to take notes. Because of this, the editor is divided into parts: a text area and iframe. 

The text area utilizes the behave.js library to have code-text editor capabilites. The iframe functions as a rich text editor for simple note taking. 

The editor uses local storage to store contents of both the text area and the iframe.
